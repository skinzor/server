# dogbin - a fancy hastebin fork! Woof!

[changelog](/changelog)

Sharing code is a good thing, and it should be _really_ easy to do it.
A lot of times, I want to show you something I'm seeing - and that's where we
use pastebins.

dogbin is the prettiest, easiest to use pastebin ever made. Even prettier than
the original hastebin, and mostly optimized for use by Android developers.

## Basic Usage

Type what you want me to see, click "Save", and then copy the URL.  Send that
URL to someone and they'll see what you see.

To make a new entry, click "New" (or type 'control + n')

### URL shortening

To shorten an URL to a fancy, short del.dog URL, just enter the URL, click "Save"
and then copy the URL. Any future calls to that URL will redirect to what you entered
earlier.

### Telegram Bot

On Telegram you can use [@haste_bot](https://t.me/haste_bot) made by
[@krypticallusion](https://t.me/krypticallusion), to create a paste or shortened
URL directly from inside TG!


## Duration

Pastes currently have no expiration time, but they may be removed at any time
without notice.

## Privacy

There should be no great expectation of privacy. Post things at your own risk.
Not responsible for any loss of data or removed pastes. Posts can possibly be indexed
by search engines.

## Open Source

dogbin can easily be installed behind your network, and it's all open source!
